          <h3 class="info-headline">I Am a novice <span>web developer</span> and aspiring <span>tester</span> based in Rzeszów</h3>
          <p>
            Hi! I am a beginner <strong>web developer</strong> and <strong>tester</strong>, and I'm about to start my career in IT. Even with little experience, I&nbsp;want to acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to make any project a success, including yours!
          </p>
          <p>
            Without cutting myself off from the experience I already have, I am open to work in new departments, to new skills, as well as to expand my knowledge and competences in areas that I have already learned. Additionally, I am open to remote work.
          </p>
          <p> 
            During 2022 and 2023, I want to make a change of business and follow my interests - move to work in the broadly understood IT. I would like to start from the position  of a web developer or manual tester, gradually moving towards an automation tester to gain extensive experience in the field of agile methods and testing, or to expand knowledge about HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
          <p> 
            I would like to get to know many projects fully and then choose the further direction of my own development in the huge world of IT. To&nbsp;fulfill my ambition, I started learning the basic of programming languages, eg. C #, JavaScript and Python just as foundations of HTML and CSS.
          <p>
            At the same time, while solving competency tests and looking for a place for myself, I noticed that I really like working with data, processing it, analyzing it, drawing conclusions and presenting, so I would like to leave this development opportunity open and, as far as possible, check myself as a data analyst or in the distant future, maybe data scientist. I am ready for cooperation and various offers. Feel&nbsp;free to talk. :)</p>
