        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3 class="info-headline">I Am a novice and aspiring <span>web developer</span> based in Rzeszów</h3>
        <p>
          Hi! I am a beginner <strong>web developer</strong>, and I'm about to start my career in IT. Even with little
          experience, I want to acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to make any project a success, including
          yours!
        </p>
        <p>
          Without cutting myself off from the experience I already have, I am open to work in new departments, to new
          skills, as well as to expand my knowledge and competences in areas that I have already learned. Additionally,
          I am open to remote work.
        </p>
        <p>
          During 2022 and 2023, I want to make a change of business and follow my interests - move to work in the
          broadly understood IT. I would like to start from the position of a web developer, gradually moving forward,
          to gain extensive experience in the field of agile methods, SCRUM and to expand knowledge about <em>HTML, CSS
          and JavaScript.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          I would like to get to know many projects fully and then choose the further direction of my own development in
          the huge world of IT. To fulfill my ambition, I started learning the basic of front-end, <u>JavaScript, just as foundations of HTML and CSS.
          </u> Later I would like to get to know Bootstrap, React or Angular/Vue and get betwe with UI/UX Design. 
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time, while solving competency tests and looking for a place for myself, I noticed that I really
          like working with data, processing it, analyzing it, drawing conclusions and presenting, so I would like to
          leave this development opportunity open and, as far as possible, check myself as a data analyst or in the
          distant future, maybe data scientist. I am ready for cooperation and various offers, to start anew.
        </p>
        <p>
          Feel&nbsp;free to talk. :)
        </p>
